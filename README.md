# Countries-Of-The-World
This website aims to create a visually engaging and interactive way to explore details about countries around the world. It uses a REST API called Rest Countries API, which is stable, up-to-date, and free to use. The website displays a grid containing cards, where each card includes the countryâ€™s flag, name, capital, and population number. The countries are ordered alphabetically and categorized into their corresponding continents, including those that are not recognized, such as Antarctica.
